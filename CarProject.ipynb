    "# Predicting the Price of Second Hand Cars in the Philippines using K-nearest Neighbor and Multiple Regression Algorithm\n",

    "### Overview of the Study\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The purchasing behavior of customers in the secondhand car market has been affected by the growing popularity of online classified advertisements and auto portals in the Philippines. The digital era’s technological advancements gave birth to various online platforms in which potential customers can explore in their journey of finding a car that would best suit their preferences. Various multi-brand dealers are strategically partnering with online classified advertisements and auto portals to make the car purchasing journey of potential buyers to be more convenient, accessible, and transparent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Act in the Philippines, new vehicles have become more expensive which results to individuals resorting to certified and non-certified secondhand vehicles. The increase in demand on public transport and ride-sharing services to relieve traffic congestions will also expand the sales of used cars in the Philippines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying secondhand cars may have its advantages (e.g., cheaper) but it also has its risks such determining the reliability of the seller and whether if a used car is overpriced or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help alleviate the worries of potential used car buyers in their purchasing journey, we will now try to develop a model that would predict the price of secondhand cars and identify which specific features/variables greatly affect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buying used cars has many advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- More savings\n",
    "- Cheaper insurance cost\n",
    "- Slower depreciation\n",
    "- Extended warranty\n",
    "- Good for the environment\n",
    "- But there are also risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unknown reliability or treatment\n",
    "- More frequent maintenance\n",
    "- Hard to find an exact match of what you want\n",
    "- Untouched warranty\n",
    "- Lemon Car / Overpriced Ca\n",

To visualize our data, we will be using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create heatmaps and a scatter matrix. To build our model, we will be using the `sklearn` library, and the evaluation will be taking place with the `statsmodels` library. I've also added a few additional modules to help calculate certain metrics."
